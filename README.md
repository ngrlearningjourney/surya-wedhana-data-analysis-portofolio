## [Project 2: Employee Analysis for a Company üè¢](https://github.com/ngrlearningjourney/surya-wedhana-data-analysis-portofolio/blob/main/employee_data_analysis.ipynb)

### Dataset Overview
This dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset) and formatted as a CSV file. It provides valuable insights into employee demographics, education, work history, and other employment-related factors within a company. The data includes 9 columns, capturing information such as education level, work tenure, age, gender, and other critical aspects.

### Data Wrangling and EDA
The first step in the analysis was to perform data wrangling, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis. This process involved:
- Checking for missing values and handling them appropriately.
- Ensuring correct data formats.
- Identifying and removing duplicated entries.

After the wrangling phase, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships within the data. Some key highlights from the analysis are:

### Key Insights:
- **1,232 employees** with a **Bachelor's degree** have not left the company.
- **328 employees** with a **Master's degree** have not left the company.
- **116 employees** with a **PhD** have not left the company.
- The highest number of employees were hired in **2017**, including:  
   - **367 Bachelor's degree holders**  
   - **227 Master's degree holders**  
   - **28 PhD holders**  
- The highest number of **Bachelor's** and **Master's** degree holders were hired in **2017**, with **367** and **227 individuals**, respectively.  
- The highest number of **PhD holders** were hired in **2013**, with **33 individuals**.
- The youngest **Bachelor's** degree holder is **22 years old**, and the oldest is **41 years old**.
- The youngest **Master's** degree holder is **23 years old**, and the oldest is **41 years old**.
- The youngest **PhD** holder is **22 years old**, and the oldest is **41 years old**.

### Classification Model
To predict whether an employee would leave the company, I built classification machine learning models using two algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of **66.7%**.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Achieved an accuracy of **71.8%**.

Both models helped identify patterns and factors contributing to employee retention and turnover.

## Key Insights

1. **Spearman Correlation Analysis**:
   - The **Percentage of Classes Attended** shows the **highest correlation** with exam scores, with a correlation coefficient of **0.672366**.
   - The **Number of Hours Spent Studying per Week** has the **second highest correlation**, with a coefficient of **0.480956**.
   - These findings highlight the **moderate positive relationship** between attendance, study habits, and exam performance, while suggesting that other factors may also influence outcomes.

2. **Study Hours by School Type**:
   - There is no significant difference in the **maximum number of hours spent studying per week** between private and public school students: **44 hours** for private school students vs. **43 hours** for public school students.
   - The **minimum study time** reported is **1 hour** per week for both school types.

3. **Teacher Quality and Exam Scores**:
   - Students with **high and medium teacher quality** achieved similar maximum exam scores (100), with average exam scores ranging between **66** and **67** across all teacher quality categories.
   
4. **Extracurricular Activities and Performance**:
   - **87 students** who scored above **75** participate in **extracurricular activities**, indicating a higher proportion of high performers among this group.
   - However, **37 students** who do not participate in extracurricular activities also scored above **75**, suggesting that extracurricular involvement may be associated with better performance, but it's not a definitive factor for all high performers.

5. **Tutoring and High Exam Scores**:
   - The majority of students with **high exam scores** (above 90) attend **tutoring sessions once a month**, making this frequency the most common among top performers.
